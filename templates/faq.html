  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Why is my download taking so long?</h3>
    <p>Download time depends on several factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Video length (longer videos take more time)</li>
      <li>Selected quality (4K takes longer than 360p)</li>
      <li>Server load and your internet connection speed</li>
      <li>YouTube's server response time</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Can I download playlists?</h3>
    <p>Currently, playlist downloads are not supported. You'll need to download videos one at a time by pasting individual video URLs.</p>
